# ❤️ Support your local businesses during the pandemic

The global Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic is hitting local business incredibly hard: in the UK, the population has been advised to steer clear of any unnecessary contact or gatherings, yet businesses have not been forced to close by government.

This leaves them without the majority of their income, but unable to claim insurance.

Many businesses are coming up with novel and creative ways to keep themselves afloat during the pandemic: restaurants are offering takeaway or delivery where they didn't before, services are opening up for paid-up-front bookings to maintain some cashflow.

This site lists those businesses with information on the special measures they're taking. Use it to support them if you're unable to give them your usual business: for many of them this is an existential threat.

## Contributing
