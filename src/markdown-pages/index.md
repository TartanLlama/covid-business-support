# ❤️ Support your local businesses during the pandemic

The global Coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic is hitting local business incredibly hard: in the UK, the population has been advised to steer clear of any unnecessary contact or gatherings, yet businesses have not been forced to close by government.

This leaves them without the majority of their income, but unable to claim insurance.

Many businesses are coming up with novel and creative ways to keep themselves afloat during the pandemic: restaurants are offering takeaway or delivery where they didn't before, services are opening up for paid-up-front bookings to maintain some cashflow.

This site lists those businesses with information on the special measures they're taking. Use it to support them if you're unable to give them your usual business: for many of them this is an existential threat.

This website is minimal, I get it. I'm making it fast, since this is an urgent situation. It'll improve over time but what's important right now is the information. If you want to help out, see the contributing section below!

## Contributing

We need to crowdsource this information. If you're handy with Github-based projects, can write a simple JSON file and are in the UK, I need you. Head to the [Github repo](https://github.com/unwitting/covid-business-support) and look at the README to get started. In most cases, adding a business is as easy as creating a small new JSON file from a template.

If you have skills in React/Gatsby-based projects and want to contribute design or copy talents, you're _more_ than welcome: this site is a public Github project, and pull requests are hugely appreciated. Find it at [unwitting/covid-business-support](https://github.com/unwitting/covid-business-support).

If neither of those are you, then please just **share** and put out the call for both contributors and customers for these businesses.

## Locations

- [Edinburgh](/businesses/locations/edinburgh)
- [Glasgow [COMING SOON]](/businesses/locations/glasgow)

### Other locations

Other locations may be available soon: I've started this to support my local businesses as quickly as possible, so my focus has been on [Edinburgh](/businesses/locations/edinburgh). If you're a developer in the UK, get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/unwttng) and we can talk about setting you up as a local contributor for a new area.

## Finally

This site is **totally unofficial** and **unaffiliated** with any government or health bodies. It's literally just a hand of support being put out by somebody who's main skills lie in making a quick website. The project was kicked off by [Jack Preston](https://twitter.com/unwttng) and they reached out for local contributors from there.

**All advice or information on this site should take a second place to current official recommendations on how to stay safe**.
